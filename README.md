Crime Catch was an exciting web-project that was built using Angular for the front-end and MongoDB Atlas for the back-end. The goal of this project was personally inspired being an international student in the United States, was to help each student or any individual find a safe area/street while travelling, or searching an accommodation, etc. This was accomplished by first obtaining a crimes data-set for Boston, MA from kaggle.com and then integrating with Angular Google Maps providing filter by crimes or streets.
